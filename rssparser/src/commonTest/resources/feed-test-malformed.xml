<p>With <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/what-is-5g-explained-944868/">5G</a> promising to bring billions of devices into the fold, Japan hopes to meet that demand by announcing plans to create 10 billion 14-digit phone numbers. As <a href="https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2019/05/15/national/japan-plans-create-10-billion-14-digit-phone-numbers-5g-era-approaching/#.XNxWwo7Yo3F"><em>The Japan Times</em></a> reported today, all the new numbers will start with the code &#8220;020.&#8221;</p>
<p>The plan is to introduce the new numbers by the end of 2021 at the latest. Three of Japan&#8217;s largest mobile operators — <a href="https://fave.co/2HxymX8">NTT Docomo</a>, <a href="https://fave.co/2HlI5AQ">KDDI</a>, and <a href="https://fave.co/2VCVCwI">SoftBank</a> — agreed to the idea and will update their systems to accommodate the 10 billion new numbers. Japan&#8217;s communications ministry plans to reward carriers for ahead-of-schedule support.</p>
<p>Japan expects to run out of 11-digit numbers as early as fiscal 2022, which starts April 1 of that year for the Japanese government.</p>
<div class="aa_srma_container shortcodes_wrapper right"><div class="shortcodes-header"><div class="shortcodes-title">Editor's Pick</div></div><div class="related_articles_wrapper"><div class="related_article_item"><a class="overlay-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/5g-device-price-959959/" title="Here’s what every 5G phone will cost you"></a><h4 class="ra-title">Here’s what every 5G phone will cost you</h4><div class="ra-excerpt">

If you want to be one of the first consumers to get your hands on a 5G phone, you’ll have to pay up. A lot of manufacturers including Samsung, LG, and Xiaomi have announced 5G …</div></div></div></div>
<p>The 14 billion new numbers sound excessive, but keep in mind that <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/what-is-the-internet-of-things-592491/">Internet of Things</a> (IoT) devices have been using 11-digit numbers that start with &#8220;020&#8221; since January 2017. Also, carriers have already taken 32.6 million of the 11-digit 020 numbers that were allocated two years ago.</p>
<p>14-digit numbers could prove troublesome for the masses, since there will be more numbers to remember. That issue could be exacerbated among Japan&#8217;s aging population. It&#8217;s estimated that people older than 60 <a href="http://www.stat.go.jp/english/data/nenkan/1431-02.htm">make up 33 percent</a> of the Japanese population.</p>
<p>Even so, we could see similar announcements in other countries that plan to deploy 5G networks and are running low on allocated phone numbers. It&#8217;s not as much of an issue in the U.S., where a <a href="http://www.nationalnanpa.com/pdf/NRUF/April_2014_NANP_Exhaust_Analysis.pdf">North American Numbering Plan exhaust analysis</a> estimates that the country&#8217;s current numbering system is sufficient until 2044.</p>

<p>After early review units <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-fold-issues-display-problems-977233/">started breaking</a>, Samsung postponed the release of its first foldable device, the <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-fold-review-977100/">Samsung Galaxy Fold</a>, and promised to work on addressing the breakage issues. Now we have a report out of South Korea from <a href="https://www.yna.co.kr/view/AKR20190515026700017"><em>Yonhap News</em></a> (via <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/2019/05/15/improvements-samsung-made-galaxy-fold/"><em>SamMobile</em></a>) that gives us our first glimpse into what Samsung could be doing to address these problems.</p>
<p>The two biggest issues with the Samsung Galaxy Fold were the protective film covering the inner screen and the gap between the display and the device&#8217;s folding hinge. Reviewers mistakenly pulled off the protective layer which caused some devices to malfunction, and the hinge gap allows for dust and other particles to contaminate the very sensitive OLED display.</p>
<p>For the protective layer problem, Samsung is reportedly integrating the edges of the film into the body of the device itself. If true, this would make it more difficult for consumers to accidentally pull the protective layer off.</p>
<div class="aa_srma_container shortcodes_wrapper right"><div class="shortcodes-header"><div class="shortcodes-title">Editor's Pick</div></div><div class="related_articles_wrapper"><div class="related_article_item"><a class="overlay-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-fold-release-decision-984575/" title="Samsung CEO: Galaxy Fold release decision coming &#8216;in a couple of days&#8217;"></a><h4 class="ra-title">Samsung CEO: Galaxy Fold release decision coming &#8216;in a couple of days&#8217;</h4><div class="ra-excerpt">

According to The Korea Herald, the new United States release date for the Samsung Galaxy Fold will be determined in the next few days.

This information comes directly from Samsung CEO Koh Dong-jin, more commonly known as …</div></div></div></div>
<p>As far as the hinge goes, the report merely suggests Samsung is working to reduce the size of the gap. This could mean that Samsung is eliminating the gap, or it could mean that it will simply be smaller and thus less prone to collecting debris.</p>
<p>Finally, there will also likely be more warnings and safety statements with the Samsung Galaxy Fold to educate consumers on how this new type of device needs to be handled.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve reached out to <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/best-samsung-phones-771831/">Samsung</a> about confirming or denying these reports and will update the article if we hear back.</p>
<p>In the meantime, what do you think about this potential progress? Would these fixes make you more comfortable with buying a Fold? Or has the damage already been done? Let us know in the comments.</p>

<p>According to a new report from <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/behind-the-intel-apple-modem-divorce"><em>The Information</em></a>, the progress surrounding Apple&#8217;s own <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/apple-intel-modems-iphone-973303/">in-house 5G modem</a> for upcoming iPhones is further behind than originally anticipated.</p>
<p>In the new report, <em>The Information&#8217;s</em> sources suggest that the iPhone 5G modem made by Apple might not be done before 2025 &#8212; a far cry from the <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/5g-iphone-intel-modem-957873/">original rumor of 2021</a>. This slow progress was likely a major factor in Apple&#8217;s recent decision to <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/apple-qualcomm-end-976634/">cease all litigation against Qualcomm</a> and sign a six-years-long deal with the company to use its modems in future iPhones.</p>
<p>Granted, it is possible Apple slowed down progress on its own 5G modem design once it knew it was going to sign the deal with Qualcomm. Obviously, there&#8217;s no point continuing to rush out a new product if Qualcomm&#8217;s modems will fill the gap for the time being.</p>
<div class="aa_srma_container shortcodes_wrapper right"><div class="shortcodes-header"><div class="shortcodes-title">Editor's Pick</div></div><div class="related_articles_wrapper"><div class="related_article_item"><a class="overlay-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/intel-5g-modem-exit-976700/" title="Intel to exit 5G smartphone modem business: Is this why Apple settled with Qualcomm?"></a><h4 class="ra-title">Intel to exit 5G smartphone modem business: Is this why Apple settled with Qualcomm?</h4><div class="ra-excerpt"> Intel 



On the same day that Apple and Qualcomm settled their long-running legal war, Intel has announced it will be leaving the 5G modem business.

The timing of Intel's announcement was rather interesting, as it was …</div></div></div></div>
<p>The report seems to back up the theory that Apple was trapped between a rock and a hard place and had little choice but to cut its losses and settle its legal fights with Qualcomm. If Apple went with Intel modems for the future iPhone 5G models, the modems would <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/apple-modems-intel-qualcomm-952069/">likely not meet the high standards</a> Apple holds for its star product. If Apple instead made the modems itself, it would be years late to the 5G game.</p>
<p>It seems that Apple had no choice but to ask Qualcomm for a truce (a truce that <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/apple-qualcomm-settlement-estimate-977840/">allegedly cost Apple billions</a>).</p>
<p>Additionally, the report dives deep into details surrounding the slow relationship deterioration between Apple and Intel. <em>The Information</em> alleges that the relationship is deteriorating even further with Apple reportedly unsatisfied with Intel&#8217;s chip performance in Mac computers. There are <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2018/10/17/apple-custom-chips-macs-apple-car/">already predictions</a> that Apple will begin to transition away from Intel chips entirely very soon, possibly even within the next year. We&#8217;ve reached out to Intel for clarification on this.</p>

<p>The OnePlus 7 Pro is OnePlus’ first attempt at a true ultra-premium flagship and I&#8217;m a little bit in love with it.</p>
<p>I’ve come to this conclusion after testing a review unit for around a week now and it&#8217;s frankly left me in a pickle. Despite the fact my day job for the past five or so years means I’m chopping and changing phones on an almost monthly basis (it&#8217;s a hard life), I’ve always gone back to a Google phone as my daily driver.</p>
<p>That could all change with the <a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8746582/type/dlg/sid/oliver.cragg/https://www.oneplus.com/">OnePlus 7 Pro</a>.</p>
<h2>Oodles of Google</h2>

<p>This trend of mine stretches back all the way to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JV3kvQDf0Do">Google Nexus 4</a>, which became my first Android phone back in 2012 after becoming jaded by incremental iPhone upgrades. The <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/why-we-love-google-nexus-5-786299/">Nexus 5</a> was my next stop and quickly cemented my love of all things Android and is probably my favorite smartphone of all-time (just behind the <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-pixel-2-xl-review-805069/">Pixel 2 XL</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPmqWOShbY8">HTC One M8</a>).</p>
<p>Those times I did waiver from Google mostly led to disappointment (what was I thinking buying an <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/looking-back-at-the-lg-g4-672482/">LG G4</a>?), but that wasn’t the case with my recent detour with the <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/oneplus-6t-review-918817/">OnePlus 6T</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Related:</strong> <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/oneplus-7-pro-vs-oneplus-6t-vs-oneplus-6-981261/">OnePlus 7 Pro vs OnePlus 6T vs OnePlus 6: What are you getting for $120 more?</a></em></p>
<p>Long story short, I managed to smash my <a href="https://fave.co/2DAC5Tj">Pixel 3 XL</a> (RIP) and needed a replacement. That role was filled by the OnePlus 6T and I was immediately wowed by its rapid speed, not to mention the smaller notch over the Pixel 3 XL&#8217;s hideous bathtub cutout.</p>
<p>It wasn’t all wonderful, though. The camera processing left a lot to be desired, I still preferred Pixel software to OxygenOS, and I hated the single speaker that I always managed to muffle when playing games and watching Twitch.</p>
<blockquote class="quote_new left" style="color: #39d266; border-color: #39d266;"><p>After seven years of Google phones, maybe it's time for a change.</p></blockquote>
<p>I’ve been flitting between the OnePlus 6T and a brand new, not smashed to pieces Google Pixel 3 XL for a few months now, trying to get a balance between the 6T’s hardware and the Pixel 3 XL’s software.</p>
<p>Then the OnePlus 7 Pro arrived at my doorstep.</p>
<p>Rather than just go over all the great and not-so-great things about the OnePlus 7 Pro, I&#8217;m going to run through all the things I would and wouldn’t miss from ditching my Pixel in the vain hope it’ll get me out of another “will I, won’t I” dilemma until the <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/new-upcoming-android-phones-2019-690821/">Pixel 4</a> rolls around.</p>

<p>If you’ve read or watched (above) our <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/oneplus-7-pro-review-981004/">OnePlus 7 Pro review</a> you already know this thing is blisteringly fast. The version I’ve got is the ludicrously over-spec’d 12GB RAM model and it’s so quick it feels like it might take off.</p>
<p>Coming to this from my irritatingly &#8212; and considering the internals inexcusably &#8212; sluggish <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-pixel-3-xl-review-911391/">Pixel 3 XL</a> is a revelation. I can now switch between a seemingly infinite number of apps at any time without having to watch them boot all over again. Thanks to UFS 3.0, bloated games like <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/pokemon-go-updates-news-events-979446/">Pokémon Go</a> also load in about half the time. It’s blissful.</p>

The OnePlus 7 Pro marks a radical shift for the Chinese brand, as it seeks to offer a more premium option than previous devices.

 	OnePlus 7 and 7 Pro are here: Everything you need to …</div></div></div></div>
<p>The overall snappy feel and tight animations are helped along by the OnePlus 7 Pro&#8217;s <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/oneplus-7-pro-battery-life-90hz-display-985616/">90Hz display</a>.</p>
<p>The display in general is absolutely stunning. I could probably count on one hand the amount of times I use a selfie camera in a single year so the trade off of a mechanized pop-up camera that could one day fail for a massive, almost entirely bezel-free screen is a no brainer.</p>

<p>The display curves are perhaps a little too extreme compared to the <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-s10-plus-review-961423/">Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus</a>, but everything else about the phone’s entire design is stunning, especially in Nebula Blue which has a mesmerizing, soft glow in the certain lights. I’ve never disliked the two-tone Pixel aesthetic, but this blows it out of the water.</p>
<div class="clear"></div><blockquote class="quote_new center" style="color: #39d266; border-color: #39d266;"><p>The OnePlus 7 Pro's 90Hz display is stunning.</p></blockquote><div class="clear"></div>
<p>Surprisingly, the in-display fingerprint sensor has been another huge upgrade. I say surprisingly because I’ve had nothing but headaches with in-display sensors, but I’ve found the hit rate on the OnePlus 7 Pro to be really high. Meanwhile, the Pixel 3 XL’s rear sensor has always been hit-and-miss for me.</p>
<p>Another plus for OnePlus (see what I did there?) is battery life. While the OnePlus 7 Pro represents a significant drop in battery endurance compared to the ultra-efficient OnePlus 6T, I can still make it through the day on OnePlus’ latest. That’s more than I get from the Pixel. The lack of <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/phones-with-wireless-charging-848173/">wireless charging</a> is a shame as I’ll have to retire my <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-pixel-stand-review-912834/">Pixel Stand</a>, but <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/oneplus-6t-mclaren-edition-warp-charge-30w-938553/">30W Warp Charge</a> support more than makes up for it.</p>

<p>As I expected, my main gripes with the OnePlus 7 Pro have very little to do with the hardware &#8212; with two minor exceptions.</p>
<p>The first is the stereo speaker setup. The 7 Pro’s speakers are a stark improvement over the OnePlus 6T’s stupidly positioned single bottom speaker, but they’re still not quite on par with the Pixel 3 XL’s dual front-facing speakers.</p>
<p>The other hardware feature I’d miss is <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-q-active-edge-remap-966776/">Active Edge</a>. I use <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-assistant-838138/">Google Assistant</a> a lot (I have five Google Home speakers and counting) so having immediate access on my phone via a quick squeeze has always been a bonus.</p>

<p>In the grand scheme of things, these are both losses I can live with. I’m not sure I can say the same about my issues with the software, however.</p>

<p>Let me be very clear: <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/oxygenos-features-879547/">OxygenOS</a> is by far my favorite OEM skin. It’s incredibly customizable, clean-looking, has almost zero bloat, and often has extra or tweaked features that are better than stock Android (most notably gestures). But I still prefer the Pixel Launcher.</p>
<div class="aa_srma_container shortcodes_wrapper right"><div class="shortcodes-header"><div class="shortcodes-title">Best OEM skin?</div></div><div class="related_articles_wrapper"><div class="related_article_item"><a class="overlay-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-skins-945375/" title="The many flavors of Android: a look at the major Android skins"></a><h4 class="ra-title">The many flavors of Android: a look at the major Android skins</h4><div class="ra-excerpt">

One of the best things about Android is how customizable it is, letting users enjoy a whole host of different flavors. Some prefer their Android clean and stock-like. Others like phone manufacturers to come up …</div></div></div></div>
<p>There’s just something about the Pixel’s simplicity and purity as part of the wider Google ecosystem &#8212; that I’m perhaps too deeply ingrained in &#8212; that I immediately mourn the absence of that signature Material Design look and feature set.</p>
<p>I can remedy this a little thanks to a <a href="http://andauth.co/AnotherWidget">helpful widget app</a> that mimics the Pixel clock and <a href="http://andauth.co/RtzXmc">Nova</a> launcher with a <a href="https://help.teslacoilapps.com/nowcompanion">sideloaded Google Discover app</a>, but it’s still not quite the same. There’s also no solution to OnePlus&#8217; continued, inexplicable refusal to add always-on display support &#8212; a very personal potential deal breaker, I admit &#8212; which is outright baffling at this point.</p>

<p>If there’s one ultimate deal breaker, however, it’s the same thing that led to me resigning the OnePlus 6T back to a drawer: the camera.</p>
<p>Last year I welcomed my daughter into the world and my photo library went from occasional shots of my cat to literally thousands of snaps of a little person, all uploaded safely to <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-photos-937968/">Google Photos</a> with unlimited original quality cloud storage and synced to my <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-home-hub-review-912398/">Google Home Hub</a> (or <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-nest-hub-camera-983875/">Nest Hub</a>, I should say).</p>
<p>On paper, the OnePlus 7 Pro camera is great. Its <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/triple-camera-wish-list-894938/">triple-lens</a> setup is far more versatile than the Pixel 3 series’ single shooter and the image quality is an obvious step up from the OnePlus 6T. The OnePlus Camera app is also simple and intuitive.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the actual results still pale in comparison to the Pixel 3 XL, especially in low light. OnePlus’ post-processing still lags way behind Google’s and when you&#8217;re taking photos that you&#8217;ll cherish forever that becomes an overwhelmingly large, emotive factor.</p>
<p>The fact that the budget <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-pixel-3a-xl-review-982622/">Pixel 3a</a> series, which I&#8217;ve also been playing around with recently, produces better results as a point-and-shoot camera phone shows just how far ahead Google is in this area compared to every Android OEM, not just OnePlus.</p>

<p>I have a feeling I’ll be going back and forth between the OnePlus 7 Pro and Google Pixel 3 XL for the next few months. The inevitable <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/google-camera-port-hub/">Pixel Camera port</a> for the OnePlus 7 Pro may throw a curveball at me, though that may make using the telephoto and ultra-wide angle sensors a little more awkward.</p>
<p>My ideal phone still sits somewhere between the two devices with OnePlus’ hardware and Google’s software. That said, I understand that I’m coming at this dilemma from a point of extreme privilege as most people don&#8217;t have multiple high-calibre phones they can pick and choose on a whim.</p>
<div class="clear"></div><blockquote class="quote_new center" style="color: #39d266; border-color: #39d266;"><p>I'm still torn.</p></blockquote><div class="clear"></div>
<p>For most buyers, the OnePlus 7 Pro offers far greater bang for your buck even when considering the price jump compared to OnePlus’ previous flagships. Likewise, if the camera is your deciding factor as it may be for me, the Pixel 3a is a much better value package than its flagship sibling.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I’m still torn. But it’s not been this close for a while.</p>

<p>The free tier of <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/spotify-tips-free-premium-978381/">Spotify</a> allows you to access a ton of music &#8212; but with some <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/spotify-tips-free-premium-978381/">severe limitations</a>, not to mention ad interruptions. Spotify Premium, however, gets you full, ad-free access to nearly everything the service offers.</p>
<p>Right now, you can give Spotify Premium a shot for three months and <a href="https://www.spotify.com/">pay only $0.99</a>. That&#8217;s not $0.99 per month, that&#8217;s $0.99 total for the entire three-month period.</p>
<p>When the trial period is over, you&#8217;ll pay the usual rate for Spotify Premium, which is currently set at $9.99 per month.</p>

Spotify finally launched its music streaming service in India in February 2019, after numerous stops and starts and despite a legal battle with Warner Music Group that rages on even today (more on this later). …</div></div></div></div>
<p>However, if after the trial you don&#8217;t want to pay the full price for the service, you can simply cancel and drop back down to the free tier. Of course, that will mean going back to ad interruptions, which you might not be able to stomach after three blissful months living ad-free.</p>
<p>This deal is live right now in both the United States and the United Kingdom. In the U.K., the charge is 99 pence for the three-month trial and then 9.99 pounds per month after the trial ends. Regardless of your location, you have until June 30 to sign up for the deal.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that you will be ineligible for this trial offer if you&#8217;ve had a Spotify Premium account before or participated in a similar trial offer in the past.</p>

<h2>Fortnite update: The latest</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Fortnite v9.01 update overview</h3>
<p><strong>Release date</strong>: May 15, 2019.</p>
<p>This minor Fortnite update comes just after the start of Season 9, and it finally addresses the elephant in the room: the Drum Gun. Its base damage has been reduced significantly, which should make it easier to deal with on the battlefield.</p>
<p>Yet another new fully automatic weapon called the Tactical Assault Rifle is dropping in, with rare, epic, and legendary versions. To pare down the number of rapid-fire weapons available, the P90 Compact SMG has been vaulted.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-986576" src="https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/fortnite-update-tactical-assault-rifle-840x473.jpg" alt="fortnite update tactical assault rifle" width="840" height="473" srcset="https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/fortnite-update-tactical-assault-rifle-840x472.jpg 840w, https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/fortnite-update-tactical-assault-rifle-300x170.jpg 300w, https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/fortnite-update-tactical-assault-rifle-768x432.jpg 768w, https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/fortnite-update-tactical-assault-rifle-16x9.jpg 16w, https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/fortnite-update-tactical-assault-rifle-32x18.jpg 32w, https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/fortnite-update-tactical-assault-rifle-28x16.jpg 28w, https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/fortnite-update-tactical-assault-rifle-56x32.jpg 56w, https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/fortnite-update-tactical-assault-rifle-64x36.jpg 64w, https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/fortnite-update-tactical-assault-rifle-712x400.jpg 712w, https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/fortnite-update-tactical-assault-rifle-1000x563.jpg 1000w, https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/fortnite-update-tactical-assault-rifle-1200x675.jpg 1200w, https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/fortnite-update-tactical-assault-rifle-792x446.jpg 792w, https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/fortnite-update-tactical-assault-rifle-1280x720.jpg 1280w, https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/fortnite-update-tactical-assault-rifle-1340x754.jpg 1340w, https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/fortnite-update-tactical-assault-rifle-770x433.jpg 770w, https://cdn57.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/fortnite-update-tactical-assault-rifle-356x200.jpg 356w" sizes="(max-width: 840px) 100vw, 840px" /></p>
<h3>Fortnite v9.01 update patch notes</h3>
<h3>What&#8217;s New?</h3>
<p><strong>Tactical Assault Rifle</strong><br />
Tactics take the day! This robust and precise assault rifle is the ideal option for tight quarters.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Weapons + Items</h3>
<ul>
<li>Tactical Assault Rifle
<ul>
<li>Available in Rare, Epic, and Legendary variants.</li>
<li>Available from Floor Loot, Chests, Supply Drops, and Vending Machines
<ul>
<li>Fully Automatic</li>
<li>30 Round Magazine</li>
<li>Deals 22/23/24 damage</li>
<li>Headshot Multiplier of 1.75x</li>
<li>This weapon has a tight spread in close quarters but is less effective at long range when compared to other Assault Rifles.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Reduced Baller health from 200 to 150
<ul>
<li><em>The primary goal of the Baller is to provide fun and exciting mobility. We feel that it still has a little too much defensive agency &#8211; this change should reduce the effectiveness there while not impacting its strengths.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Drum Gun adjustments
<ul>
<li>Reduced base damage from 26/27 to 22/23
<ul>
<li><em>Since its unvaulting, the Drum Gun effectiveness has been slightly higher than we wanted. This change should reduce its combat effectiveness while still retaining its flavor.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Vaulted Compact SMG
<ul>
<li><em>Due to the recent addition of the Drum Gun and the brand new Tactical Assault Rifle, we wanted to reduce the availability of high rate-of-fire weapons.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 dir="ltr">Gameplay</h3>
<ul>
<li>Slipstream adjustments
<ul>
<li>Slipstreams no longer block building.
<ul>
<li><em>Trying to build up to get into a Slipstream should be an easy &amp; intuitive experience. We noticed some cases where players would build up to the Slipstream, but due to build restrictions would take a ‘leap of faith’ and not make the jump. This should make getting into a Slipstream easier.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Players flying in a Slipstream will destroy player built objects when they collide.</li>
<li>Slipstreams are now disabled after storm phase 5.
<ul>
<li><em>We’ve seen a number of cases where Slipstreams caused issues during late game circles &#8211; primarily around getting pulled into the storm unexpectedly. Since the value of Slipstream mobility is limited in those scenarios, we felt it’s better to simply disable them.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Performance</h3>
<ul>
<li>Improvements made to level streaming performance on all platforms.
<ul>
<li>This will reduce cases of buildings not loading in.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Physics optimizations to improve performance in conduits</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Endgame &#8211; Limited Time Mode</strong></p>
<p>Join the battle for the Infinity Stones! Fight as Chitauri and Thanos or wield Avengers items in the Endgame LTM.</p>
<h4>LIMITED TIME MODE: ENDGAME</h4>
<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>Thanos and his Chitauri invade the Battle Royale island, in search of the six Infinity Stones.</p>
<p><strong>Mode Details</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>Endgame features a team of heroes fighting to stop Thanos and his Chitauri from claiming all six Infinity Stones.</li>
<li>Both teams respawn when eliminated until the other side completes their objective.</li>
<li>On one side is the Hero team. Heroes respawn when eliminated until the enemy team has found all six Infinity Stones.</li>
<li>Heroes start with a treasure map that leads directly to a Mythic Avengers item.</li>
<li>Other Avengers items can be found in Chests throughout the map.</li>
<li>The goal for the Hero team is to destroy the Chitauri army and defeat Thanos.</li>
<li>Team Thanos is comprised of Chitauri Invaders and Thanos himself.</li>
<li>Chitauri Invaders start with a powerful laser rifle, an anti-structure grenade attack, and a jetpack that lets them briefly leap high into the air.</li>
<li>The first Chitauri to recover an Infinity stone will be transformed into Thanos.</li>
<li>Thanos has a powerful punch, a destructive beam attack, and the ability to jump high into the air and then smash anything in his way when he comes back down.</li>
<li>Each time an Infinity Stone is claimed, Thanos&#8217; abilities grow more powerful and the Chitauri gain health.
<ul>
<li>Reality Stone (Red) = Heath &amp; Shields doubled (1000-&gt;2000)</li>
<li>Soul Stone (Orange) = Siphon activated (grants Thanos shields only)</li>
<li>Mind Stone (Yellow) = Jump height doubled</li>
<li>Space Stone (Blue) = Ground Pound AOE size tripled, damage x6</li>
<li>Time Stone (Green) = Big knockback added to each hit, damage x3</li>
<li>Power Stone (Purple) = Laser damage x6</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If Thanos is eliminated from the match, another Chitauri will become him after a short wait (unless Thanos is the last one standing).</li>
<li>If Thanos &amp; the Chitauri find all six Infinity Stones, Heroes will no longer be able to respawn.</li>
<li>The goal for Thanos and his army is to find the stones and then eliminate the remaining heroes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>WEAPONS + ITEMS</h4>
<p><strong>Bug Fixes &amp; Improvements</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>The Hold to Swap functionality is now confirmed upon releasing the Use button rather than when initially pressing it.
<ul>
<li>This should help with the issue of accidentally swapping.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If a player is eliminated by fall damage while inside a vehicle, the player that last damaged that vehicle will receive the credit for that elimination.</li>
<li>Re-enabled hit markers to be server-side authoritative instead of client-side.
<ul>
<li>This will help prevent instances where players see hit markers but no damage.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Players that were Rebooted into Rifts were teleporting into the sky but would not enter skydiving mode.</li>
<li>Vehicles weren’t getting impulsed away from the Reboot Van.</li>
<li>Collision for the Reboot Van was not affecting some vehicles, allowing them to hide inside of the Reboot Van.</li>
<li>The yellow “invulnerability” effect wasn’t appearing on players who were revived by the Reboot Van.</li>
<li>The Reboot Card was still playing its spawn sound even if the player disconnected.</li>
<li>Dropping inventory items while in vehicles with weapons is now blocked to prevent various camera issues.</li>
<li>Traps were occasionally being placed in the middle of a tile rather than against a wall when using Builder Pro.</li>
<li>When exiting vehicles, the equip animation will now always play before weapons can be fired.
<ul>
<li>This will prevent the issue where players would occasionally see themselves fire right after exiting a vehicle before the server had time to register the shot.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The elimination feed text will no longer display the “eliminated by ally” message if an ally interrupts a player reboot animation.</li>
<li>Fall damage was being taken when using a Jetpack (in supported Limited Time Modes) after being launched from the Pirate Cannon.</li>
<li>Players were not able to negate fall damage using a Flintlock Pistol while crouching.</li>
<li>Players couldn’t see the nameplates of party member’s Reboot Cards in the UI.</li>
<li>Players would not drop a Reboot Card if they were eliminated after confirming a Reboot but before their teammate actually spawned.</li>

<p><a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/corning-foldable-gorilla-glass-962682/">Corning</a> is currently attending Display Week in San Jose, CA. During the three-day event, the company is launching its newest product called Astra Glass, which will be geared towards high-performance tablets, notebooks, and televisions.</p>
<p>One of Corning&#8217;s star products is <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/corning-foldable-gorilla-glass-962682/">Gorilla Glass</a> which appears on many smartphones around the world. The <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/gorilla-glass-6-ink-jet-887571/">sixth iteration of Gorilla Glass</a> will continue to be the glass-of-choice for most 2019 flagships.</p>
<p>Astra Glass is designed for devices larger than smartphones. It&#8217;s precisely engineered to enable the higher pixel density of high-performance displays to come through. This will create brighter, faster, and more lifelike images on future <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/best-business-tablets-821905/">tablets</a>, laptops, and 8K TVs.</p>

<p>Corning is positioning Astra Glass as its most-premium offering when it comes to larger displays. In other words, if in the future you find yourself eyeing a tablet with Astra Glass, that tablet will likely be pretty expensive.</p>
<p>Han Yim &#8212; business director at Corning &#8212; promises that Astra Glass will provide manufacturers with &#8220;low total pitch variation, low total thickness variation, and low sag,” when it comes to high-end displays.</p>
<p>With the recent launch of the <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/oneplus-7-pro-vs-oneplus-7-985187/">OnePlus 7 Pro</a> and its top-of-the-line <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/oneplus-7-pro-battery-life-90hz-display-985616/">90Hz display</a>, high-end display technologies could be the next big feature manufacturers focus on when releasing new products. Corning is likely trying to come out ahead of that trend with Astra.</p>

<p>Hype for <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/virtual-reality-work-702049/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">virtual reality</a> has certainly died down over the past couple of years, owing to a combination of expensive hardware, so-so performance and motion sickness, and a lack of user content. The industry is currently stuck in a bit of a chicken vs. egg scenario, where a lack of consumers deters investment in high-end content. More powerful and cost-effective VR hardware for the masses will be needed to break the deadlock.</p>

Virtual reality is taking off in a big way. However, it is still a very young industry. There are several VR platforms, including three mobile platforms with Google Cardboard, Google Daydream, and Gear VR. Of …</div></div></div></div>
<p>Arm is looking to overcome some of these technological hurdles with its first ever display processor (DPU) designed specifically for VR: the Mali-D77. In a nutshell, the Mali-D77 offloads common VR processing tasks from the GPU, freeing up resources for higher frame rates while also helping to reduce motion sickness.</p>
<h2>Inside the Arm Mali-D77</h2>
<p>Much of the Mali-D77 is based on 2017&#8217;s <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/arm-releases-trio-of-new-display-related-tech-810987/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mali-D71</a> for flagship smartphones and other high-end applications. It has the same compression decoder, layer scaling, HDR support, and color management units. However, the new design has been optimized to support 3K resolutions at 120fps, with support for 4K resolutions at up to 90fps.</p>
<p>The major changes come in the form of two brand new hardware acceleration units for VR applications. The Mali-D77 supports Lens Correction and Asynchronous Timewarp in hardware, rather than running these algorithms on the GPU. Arm estimates this can free up about 15 percent of GPU resources, which can be put towards boosting frame rates. Moving this load over to the DPU also provides a 40 percent bandwidth saving and 180mW of power per VR layer. Nice.</p>
<p>Lens Correction is required in VR headsets to offset the light curvature of the headset&#8217;s lenses. Barrel Distortion is applied to each rendered frame in order to offset the Pincushion Distortion effect of the lenses. Think of this as overcompensating or &#8220;reverse distortion&#8221; so that the lens distortion actually ends up displaying the correct image. Traditionally this is done on the GPU, taking up extra cycles and time. The Mali-D77 does this all on the DPU.</p>

<p>In addition, the Mali-D77 performs chromatic aberration correction using a similar reverse distortion method. With this applied, image colors will be displayed correctly across the entire lens, including in the corners where color separation distortion can occur.</p>
<h2>What is Asynchronous Timewarp?</h2>
<p>Lens Correction is rather self-explanatory, but Asynchronous Timewarp is a little more involved. Here, Arm is using the display processor to rotate, skew, and warp images to compensate for the wearer&#8217;s movements while mitigating any GPU or other display pipeline latency.</p>
<p>With current generation hardware, X, Y, Z axis movement tracking is updated in sync with the GPU, because the GPU has to render the change in view each time you move. With Asynchronous Timewarp, the two are no-longer-updated together. You can move your head in between GPU frame updates, and the Mali-D77 can warp the current frame to match your head movement.</p>

<p>This is a subtle effect, as it only lasts for a fraction of a second in between rendered frames and doesn&#8217;t eradicate the need for fast frame rate rendering. However, it greatly increases the fluidity and smoothness of movement and motion, as updates can occur even more frequently than the GPU frame rate. The disconnect between your body moving and seeing a visual update is the leading cause of motion sickness in VR, so the Mali-D77 can help a lot in this regard.</p>
<p>X, Y, Z axis movement data is fed directly to the Mali-D77 from the CPU, bypassing the GPU stage entirely. This is a very different way of doing things and as such will require developers to utilize a new set of development tools and techniques. This is arguably the biggest hurdle with the D77. Fortunately, Arm engineers work closely with initiatives like <a href="https://vrsource.com/khronos-announces-openxr-initiative-virtual-reality-9233/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenXR</a>, so we could see an API announcement for simplified developer support in the future.</p>
<hr />
<p>Overall, the Arm Mali-D77 is an intelligent and logical progression of the heterogeneous computing idea to help solve some of virtual reality&#8217;s biggest hardware issues. There are still other hurdles in the wireless communication, tracking, and cost segments of VR left to solve before mainstream adoption can be reconsidered, but the Mali-D77 helps to crack some of the performance issues.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/best-huawei-phones-783870/">Huawei</a> chairman Liang Hua (via <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-huawei-security-britain-chairman/huawei-willing-to-sign-no-spy-agreements-with-governments-chairman-idUSKCN1SK1HL"><em>Reuters</em></a>), the company is willing to sign &#8220;no-spy&#8221; agreements with governments, including the United Kingdom. The pacts would ensure Huawei is legally responsible to prevent backdoor spying on other nations using Huawei equipment.</p>
<p>“We are willing to sign no-spy agreements with governments, including the U.K. government, to commit ourselves to making our equipment meet the no-spy, no-backdoors standard,” Hua told reporters in London via an interpreter.</p>
<p>The statement is in response to pressures from the United States on European countries to avoid using Huawei telecommunications gear over fears of the company using that equipment to spy on other nations and report findings to the Chinese government.</p>

It looks like 2019 will be the year the first foldable smartphones with flexible displays will be available for sale to the general public. Companies like Samsung, LG, and Oppo have revealed they intend to …</div></div></div></div>
<p>Huawei is criticized relentlessly for <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/huawei-poland-spying-arrests-942485/">allegedly participating in espionage activities</a> under direction from the Chinese government, an accusation that is repeatedly denied by both Huawei and China and has never been fully proven.</p>
<p>The United Kingdom is currently deciding how much Huawei equipment it will use for the deployment of its 5G networks.</p>
<p>“The security and resilience of the [United Kingdom&#8217;s] telecoms networks is of paramount importance, and we have strict controls for how Huawei equipment is currently deployed in the U.K.,” a British government spokesman said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The U.K. will decide soon about Huawei&#8217;s involvement in its telco infrastructure and these promises from the company are likely an attempt to assure the government there is nothing to fear.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the U.S., President Donald Trump is <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-china-huawei-tech-exclusive/exclusive-trump-expected-to-sign-order-paving-way-for-u-s-telecoms-ban-on-huawei-idUSKCN1SK2P1">soon expected</a> to sign an order which would effectively ban all U.S. telecoms from using Huawei equipment.</p>
