            <p id="b46vcm">Google has been ordered to pay Sonos ${'$'}32.5 million for infringing on the company’s smart speaker patent. A <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23826599-google-sonos-trial-verdict?responsive=1&amp;title=1">jury verdict</a> issued in a San Francisco courtroom on Friday found that Google’s smart speakers and media players infringed on one of two Sonos patents at issue.</p>

Google has also <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/6/22871304/google-home-speaker-group-volume-control-changes-sonos-patent-decision">had to pull some features</a> from its lineup of smart speakers and smart displays.</p>
