                    "<p>With <a href=\"https://www.androidauthority.com/what-is-5g-explained-944868/\">5G</a> promising to bring billions of devices into the fold, Japan hopes to meet that demand by announcing plans to create 10 billion 14-digit phone numbers. As <a href=\"https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2019/05/15/national/japan-plans-create-10-billion-14-digit-phone-numbers-5g-era-approaching/#.XNxWwo7Yo3F\"><em>The Japan Times</em></a> reported today, all the new numbers will start with the code &#8220;020.&#8221;</p>\n" +
                    "<p>The plan is to introduce the new numbers by the end of 2021 at the latest. Three of Japan&#8217;s largest mobile operators — <a href=\"https://fave.co/2HxymX8\">NTT Docomo</a>, <a href=\"https://fave.co/2HlI5AQ\">KDDI</a>, and <a href=\"https://fave.co/2VCVCwI\">SoftBank</a> — agreed to the idea and will update their systems to accommodate the 10 billion new numbers. Japan&#8217;s communications ministry plans to reward carriers for ahead-of-schedule support.</p>\n" +
                    "<p>Japan expects to run out of 11-digit numbers as early as fiscal 2022, which starts April 1 of that year for the Japanese government.</p>\n" +

                    "If you want to be one of the first consumers to get your hands on a 5G phone, you’ll have to pay up. A lot of manufacturers including Samsung, LG, and Xiaomi have announced 5G …</div></div></div></div>\n" +
                    "<p>The 14 billion new numbers sound excessive, but keep in mind that <a href=\"https://www.androidauthority.com/what-is-the-internet-of-things-592491/\">Internet of Things</a> (IoT) devices have been using 11-digit numbers that start with &#8220;020&#8221; since January 2017. Also, carriers have already taken 32.6 million of the 11-digit 020 numbers that were allocated two years ago.</p>\n" +
                    "<p>14-digit numbers could prove troublesome for the masses, since there will be more numbers to remember. That issue could be exacerbated among Japan&#8217;s aging population. It&#8217;s estimated that people older than 60 <a href=\"http://www.stat.go.jp/english/data/nenkan/1431-02.htm\">make up 33 percent</a> of the Japanese population.</p>\n" +
                    "<p>Even so, we could see similar announcements in other countries that plan to deploy 5G networks and are running low on allocated phone numbers. It&#8217;s not as much of an issue in the U.S., where a <a href=\"http://www.nationalnanpa.com/pdf/NRUF/April_2014_NANP_Exhaust_Analysis.pdf\">North American Numbering Plan exhaust analysis</a> estimates that the country&#8217;s current numbering system is sufficient until 2044.</p>\n" +
