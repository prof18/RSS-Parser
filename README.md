**RSS Parser** is a Kotlin Multiplatform library for parsing RSS and Atom feeds. It supports Android, iOS, and the JVM.

With **RSS Parser**, you can fetch plenty of useful information from any RSS channel, be it a blog, magazine, or even a podcast feed.

## Installation

RSS Parser is currently published to Maven Central, so add it to your project's repositories.

```kotlin
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
    // ...
}
```

Then, add the dependency to your common source set's dependencies.

```kotlin
commonMain {
    dependencies {
        // ...
        implementation("com.prof18.rssparser:rssparser:<latest-version>")
    }
}
```

If you are in an Android-only project, simply add the dependency:

```kotlin
dependencies {
    // ...
    implementation("com.prof18.rssparser:rssparser:<latest-version>")
}
```

## Important Notices

### Artifact change

Since February 2022, the library artifacts have been moved to MavenCentral. The group ID changed from `com.prof.rssparser` to `com.prof18.rssparser`.
Be sure to add the gradle dependency to your root `build.gradle` file.
```
allprojects {
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
    }
}
```

### Breaking changes

From version 6.0, RSSParser has become Multiplatform. This update brought some breaking changes:

- Some class names and packages have been changed. Check out the [migration guide](#migration-from-version-5) for further info.
- Caching of feeds is not supported anymore. After some consideration, I decided that the aim of this library is not meant to provide a caching solution for RSS feeds, but just to do the parsing. The user of the library should implement any caching/storing solutions their project requires.
- Support for Java with the `OnTaskCompleted` and `onError` callbacks has been dropped. You can still use the library in a Java project, but you will need to write some Kotlin code to handle Coroutines. More details in the [section below](#using-the-library-in-a-java-project).

[Here](https://github.com/prof18/RSS-Parser/blob/version-5/README.md) you can find the README for version 5 of RSSParser.

## Usage

RssParser uses [Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coroutines-overview.html) for all the asynchronous work.

### Creating an RssParser instance

An `RssParser` instance is the entry point of the library. 

It's possible to create an instance of `RssParser` directly in the common code, without having to pass any platform-specific dependencies. 

```kotlin
val rssParser: RssParser = RssParser()
```

#### Builder

An `RssParser` instance can also be built with a platform-specific `RssParserBuilder`. Some custom and optional fields can be provided to the builder.

**On Android and the JVM**, a custom `OkHttpClient` instance and a custom `Charset` can be provided. If an `OkHttpClient` instance is not provided, the library will create one. If no `Charset` is provided, it will automatically be inferred from the feed XML.

```kotlin
val builder = RssParserBuilder(
    callFactory = OkHttpClient(),
    charset = Charsets.UTF_8,
)
val rssParser = builder.build() 
```

**On iOS**, a custom `NSURLSession` instance can be provided. If an `NSURLSession` instance is not provided, the library will use the shared `NSURLSession`. 

```kotlin
val builder = RssParserBuilder(
    nsUrlSession = NSURLSession(),
)
val rssParser = builder.build() 
```

### RSS Parsing from URL
To parse an RSS feed from a URL, the suspending `getRssChannel` function can be used.

```kotlin
val rssChannel: RssChannel = rssParser.getRssChannel("https://www.rssfeed.com")
```

### RSS Parsing from string

To parse an RSS feed from an XML string, the suspending `parse` function can be used

```kotlin
val xmlString: String = "xml-string"
val rssChannel: RssChannel = rssParser.parse(xmlString)
```

### Using the library in a Java project

The support for Java with the `OnTaskCompleted` and `onError` callbacks has been dropped.
However, you can still use the library in a Java project, but you will need to write some Kotlin code to handle Coroutines. 

You can transform a Coroutine into a `CompletableFuture` using the `future` extension function from
the `kotlinx-coroutines-core` library. 

```kotlin
fun parseFeed(parser: RssParser, url: String): CompletableFuture<RssChannel> = GlobalScope.future {
    parser.getRssChannel(url)
}
```

then, in your Java code, you can use the `CompletableFuture` API to handle the result.

```java
RssParser parser = new RssParserBuilder().build();
try {
    RssChannel channel = parseFeed(parser, urlString).get();
    setChannel(channel);
} catch (Exception e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
    snackbar.postValue("An error has occurred. Please try again");
}
```
An implementation of these code snippets is available in the [Java sample](samples/java/src/main/java/com/prof/rssparser/sample/java/), in `CoroutineBridge.kt` and `MainViewModel.java`.

N.B. To use CompletableFuture, you need to have a minimum API level of 24.

If you prefer Guava's `ListenableFuture`, you can use the `listenableFuture` extension function 
from the `kotlinx-coroutines-guava` library. 
More info in the official documentation [here](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines/blob/master/integration/kotlinx-coroutines-guava/README.md).

## Sample projects

The repository contains three samples projects: a [multiplatform](/samples/multiplatform), 
an [Android](/samples/android) and an [Android with Java](samples/java) project to showcase the
usage in a multiplatform app and an Android one.

## Migration from version 5

Version 6 of the library introduced the following breaking changes:

- The main package name has been changed from `com.prof.rssparser` to `com.prof18.rssparser`;
- `com.prof.rssparser.Parser` has been moved and renamed to `com.prof18.rssparser.RssParser`;
- `com.prof.rssparser.Parser.Builder` has been moved and renamed to `com.prof18.rssparser.RssParserBuilder`;
- `com.prof.rssparser.Channel` has been moved and renamed to `com.prof18.rssparser.model.RssChannel`;
- `com.prof.rssparser.Article` has been moved and renamed to `com.prof18.rssparser.model.RssItem`;
- `com.prof.rssparser.HTTPException` has been moved and renamed to `com.prof18.rssparser.exception.HttpException`;
- `com.prof.rssparser.Image` has been moved and renamed to `com.prof18.rssparser.RssImage`;
- `com.prof.rssparser.ItunesOwner` has been moved to `com.prof18.rssparser.model.ItunesOwner`;
- `com.prof.rssparser.ItunesArticleData` has been moved and renamed to `com.prof18.rssparser.model.ItunesItemData`;
- `com.prof.rssparser.ItunesChannelData` has been moved to `com.prof18.rssparser.model.ItunesChannelData`;
- `getChannel()` has been renamed to `getRssChannel()`;
- `cancel()` is not available anymore, the cancellation can be handled by the caller.
